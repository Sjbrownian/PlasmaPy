`~plasmapy.diagnostics.charged_particle_radiography.Tracker` no longer
supports making changes to an instantiated object and
re-running the simulation.  Subsequent simulations should be performed
by instantiating a new
`~plasmapy.diagnostics.charged_particle_radiography.Tracker` object and
running.
