Added the `~plasmapy.particles.particle_collections.ParticleList.average_particle`
method to |ParticleList|. This method returns a particle with the mean mass and
charge of the |ParticleList|. The ``use_rms_charge`` and ``use_rms_mass`` keyword
arguments make this method calculate the root mean square charge and mass, respectively.
The ``abundances`` keyword argument allows the calculation of the mean or root
mean square to be weighted.
