Fixed a bug in the volume-averaged interpolator for
`~plasmapy.plasma.grids.CartesianGrid`
(`~plasmapy.plasma.grids.CartesianGrid.volume_averaged_interpolator`).
The old method miss interpreted where the interpolation point was
inside the nearest neighbor cell volume.  So, if an interpolation point
was at the lower bounds of the nearest neighbor cell volume, then the
position was flipped and interpreted as being at the upper bounds of the
cell volume, and visa-versa.
